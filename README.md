# AtCanFishDat
A resource for those of us working with Atlantic Canadian commercial fishing and survey data.

Canada has a long history of collecting and maintaining fisheries data for science use. These databases are large and have been evolving with relatively little documentation to support their use and interpretation since about 1967. Knowledge and insight on the use of the tables within each schema is generally passed on to new users from current users. This approach is frustrating and inefficient and can lead to big mistake. Hopefully, this repo will reduce mistakes and speed the learning.
This read me and the repo will be constantly evolving as we grow the information on the various databases. 
We will need to provide a list of tables and defintions for each of the variables in each schema. We will also need to show how to extract data in support of typical fisheries science analyses.
Given that these schema are maintained by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, this repo will be most beneficial to current and future employees of said organization.
