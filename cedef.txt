             This field, which will be normally set to the DATE-LANDED          
             field as specified on the last page of a log, is used to           
             create the key which joins slip headers with slip details.         
             Note that it may later be determined that a number of log          
             lines actually belong with a trip other than was first

             pounds on the estimate detail record. This is a convenience

             on the log. The entered value : ESTIMATE-QTY , is converted
